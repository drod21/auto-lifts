### 1. **Day Selection Interface**:

- Display a week view with all 7 days listed (e.g., Monday through Sunday).
- Each day can be toggled between "Workout", "Rest", and "Cardio". This can be done using buttons, dropdowns, or toggle switches.
- By default, all days can be set to "Workout".

### 2. **Rest Day Selection**:

- Users can click on any day to toggle it to "Rest".
- When a day is set to "Rest", it should be visually distinct (e.g., grayed out or highlighted in a different color).
- A tooltip or info icon can be provided to explain the importance of rest days.

### 3. **Cardio Selection**:

- Users can click on any day to toggle it to "Cardio".
- Days set to "Cardio" can have a different visual cue (e.g., a different color or an icon).
- Users can specify the type of cardio (e.g., running, cycling, HIIT) and its duration/intensity if needed.
- An option to add notes or specific cardio routines can be beneficial.

### 4. **Workout Day Configuration**:

- For days set to "Workout", users can click to configure the specific exercises, sets, reps, and weights.
- A search bar or dropdown can allow users to select exercises from the database.
- Users can specify the order of exercises, rest intervals, and any supersets or circuits.

### 5. **Program Overview**:

- Once the user has configured the week, provide an overview or summary of the program.
- This can include the total number of workout days, rest days, cardio days, and total exercises.
- Users should have the option to save, edit, or share their program.

### 6. **Additional Features**:

- **Templates**: Offer pre-made templates for common goals (e.g., strength training, weight loss, muscle gain).
- **Progression**: Integrate the APRE method or other progression schemes to auto-adjust workouts.
- **Feedback**: Allow users to provide feedback on each workout, which can be used for future auto-regulation.
- **Sharing**: Users can share their programs with friends or on social media.
- **Printing/Exporting**: Users can print their program or export it to a PDF.

### 7. **User Interface Considerations**:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the tool works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Intuitive UI**: Use clear icons, tooltips, and labels to guide users.
- **Progress Save**: Allow users to save their progress and come back to finish later.

### Mockup:

Here's a simple textual mockup for clarity:

```
[ Monday ] [ Tuesday ] [ Wednesday ] [ Thursday ] [ Friday ] [ Saturday ] [ Sunday ]

[ Workout ]   [ Rest ]   [ Workout ]   [ Cardio ]   [ Workout ]   [ Rest ]   [ Workout ]

- Click on a day to configure its activities.
- Drag and drop exercises to reorder.
- Use the search bar to add new exercises.
```

This is a basic design idea, and you can refine it further based on user feedback and specific requirements.
